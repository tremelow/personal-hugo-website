I am an assistant teacher at [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) (Grenoble INP) and a member of [Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/) (Universit Grenoble-Alpes).  

My research focuses on multi-scale methods in a numerical context. More specifically I take inspiration from methods for highly-oscillatory problems, such as averaging and micro-macro expansions, and adapt it to rapidly dissipating problems using the same framework. I completed my PhD in December 2021 in Rennes under the supervision of P. Chartier and M. Lemou.
